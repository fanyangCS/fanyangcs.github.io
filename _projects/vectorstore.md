Vector store is an important storage system in the AI era. I believe it not only serves as an cache that retrieves results produced by neural networks, but also becomes (or will become) a fundamental component at the core of AI. 

Here are some of our thoughts on vector store.
- Integrating vector indices with relational databases using relaxed monotonicity. {% cite DBLP:conf/osdi/ZhangXCSXCCH00Y23 %}.
- Updating a vector index incrementally. {% cite DBLP:conf/sosp/XuLLXCZLYYYCY23 %}.
- Vector indices can be dense or sparse. Instead of represented with separated solutions, they can be unified with one generic design. {% cite 10.1145/3589335.3648338 %}.
