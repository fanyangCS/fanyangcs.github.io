My name is Fan Yang (杨凡 in Chinese). I am a systems researcher and research manager of the [Systems Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-asia/) (SRG) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSR-Asia). I joined MSR-Asia after receiving my doctoral degree and bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at Nanjing University. 

My research passion is on Computer Systems. My recent focus is to explore the fundamental principles of the systems for Artificial Intelligence (AI). I am among the first to share some interesting systems principles on [deep learning scheduling](https://github.com/microsoft/pai), [AI compiler](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/building-a-heavy-metal-quartet-of-ai-compilers/), [AutoML tool](https://github.com/microsoft/nni), [vector store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/unified-database-laying-the-foundation-for-large-language-model-vertical-applications/), and [Agent](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/parrot-efficient-serving-of-llm-based-applications-with-semantic-variable/). Some of the techniques discovered (or rediscovered) from the principles have been open-sourced and adopted by Microsoft products like Azure, M365, and Bing, and the corresponding research results have appeared in top system conferences like OSDI/SOSP. More recently, I have been passionate about the codesign of AI alogrithms and systems, which I believe will define the next chapter of AI. In the past, I worked on large-scale systems like graph systems. I co-developed [GraM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2806777.2806849), a high-performance graph processing system that set a new speed record for trillion-scale graph analytics.

As a researcher, I sometimes also engage in public academic services, including serving on the program committee of ASPLOS ([2022](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2022/index.html%3Fp=44.html)), EuroSys ([2023](https://2023.eurosys.org/pc.html), [2025](https://2025.eurosys.org/pc.html)), ChinaSys (19th).
