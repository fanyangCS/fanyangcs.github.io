My name is Fan Yang (杨凡 in Chinese). I am a systems researcher and research manager of the [Systems Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-asia/) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSR-Asia). I joined MSR-Asia after receiving my doctoral degree and bachelor's degree in [computer science](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at Nanjing University. 

My research passion is on Computer Systems. Recently I have been exploring the fundamental principles behind the systems for artificial intelligence. The exploration on Deep Learning Cluster, Compiler, and Vector storage leads to several open-source projects, including [OpenPAI](https://github.com/microsoft/pai), [NNI](https://github.com/microsoft/nni), [NNFusion](https://github.com/microsoft/nnfusion), [nnScaler](https://github.com/microsoft/nnScaler), and [VBase](https://github.com/microsoft/MSVBase). Some of the techniques therein have been adopted by Microsoft products like Azure, M365, and Bing, and the corresponding research results have appeared in top system conferences like OSDI/SOSP. As a researcher, I occasionally engage in public academic services, including serving on the program committee of ASPLOS ([2022](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2022/index.html%3Fp=44.html)), EuroSys ([2023](https://2023.eurosys.org/pc.html), [2025](https://2025.eurosys.org/pc.html)), ChinaSys (19th).
