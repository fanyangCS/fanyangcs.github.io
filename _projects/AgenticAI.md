Agent is an old name, but the importance of agent in this AI era has been well [recoganized](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents). 
An agent can be viewed as a neural-symbolic approach, as discussed [here](https://fanyangcs.github.io/projects/neuralsymbolic/), but the implication goes far beyond this view.
It is worth noting that Agent will influence the future of systems. 
For example, will the future LLM serving systems look more like Parrot {%cite parrot24 %}, or do we need to build new RL simulators like Android Arena {%cite 10.1145/3637528.3671650 %} to enable OS agent?
