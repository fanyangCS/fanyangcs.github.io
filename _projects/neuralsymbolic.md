I believe a [neuro-symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI) approach is the only way to realize truthworthy reasoning, thus achieving true intelligence. It is probably the only hope to bridge the seemingly insurmountable gap between "correlation" and "causality".

Here are some useful cases of the neural symbolic approach. And by now neuro-symbolic reasoning has become mainstream. Here is a [podcast](https://fanyangcs.github.io/blog/2025/OnAIReasoning/) where I talked about AI reasoning.
