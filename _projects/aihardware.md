The future of AI depends on whether we can design next generation hardware that better supports the [scaling laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361). 
At some point of time, AI model architecture will even be influenced by the design decision on AI hardware. 
The codesign of AI and hardware will become norm in the future.

Here are some considerations on AI hardware.
- A hardware architecture considering activation outliers in LLM inferencing.  OliVe {% cite DBLP:conf/isca/0003THL00LG023 %}
- Taking the low-bit trend of LLMs into account. An adaptive numerical data type: ANT {% cite DBLP:conf/micro/00030LL0LG022 %}. Replacing MAC with Lookup Table (LUT) {% cite lutcore25 %}. Vector quantization {% cite lutdla25 %}.
- Future AI chips will show stronger non-uniformity. Wafer scale LLM system is coming {% cite waferllm25 %}
