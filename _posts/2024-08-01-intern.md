If you consider yourself a good system guy and look for an internship at MSR-Asia, please drop me an email. I also recruit students taking a gap year. 

If you are interested in systems research and don’t know where to begin with, you could start by reading the papers mentioned [here](https://www.sigops.org/awards/hof/).

If you are looking for advice on your research, Richard Hamming’s talk on “[You and Your Research](/assets/pdf/YouAndYourResearch.pdf)” is a must-read.
