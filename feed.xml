It’s a bit like how cloud companies charge you per I/O request, except here, you’re paying for every <em>token</em>, a chunk of text your AI sends or receives.</p> <p>The more tokens you use, the happier the seller.</p> <p>This simple and intuitive model has a twist: if the same company that sells you tokens also builds the model, it suddenly has a quiet incentive to make the model talk more. Longer replies mean more tokens. More tokens mean more dollars.</p> <p>And that sets up a little tension between users (who want quick, to-the-point answers) and model providers (who wouldn’t mind a bit of extra verbosity).</p> <p>But where there’s tension, there’s opportunity.</p> <p>We might soon see a new kind of AI business emerge — one that charges per <em>task</em>, not per token.</p> <p>Imagine an AI help-desk service that bills you only when it actually solves your tech issue, not for every word it types along the way. That’s like how Walmart or Costco makes money by selling goods. Their incentive aligns with their customers, i.e., to keep the prices down. A task-based AI would think the same way:</p> <p><em>“How do I give you the answer in fewer tokens?”</em></p> <p>If that happens, the economics of AI could shift from charging for how much the model talks to charging for what the model gets done.</p> <p>Doesn’t that feel like a healthier direction for everyone?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[where there's tension, there's opportunity; the economics of AI]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">To prospective interns</title><link href="https://fanyangcs.github.io/blog/2024/intern/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="To prospective interns"/><published>2024-08-01T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-01T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://fanyangcs.github.io/blog/2024/intern</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fanyangcs.github.io/blog/2024/intern/"><![CDATA[<p>If you consider yourself a good systems guy and looking for an internship at MSR-Asia, please drop me an email.

It happened in ‘05. Not 2005, but 1905.</p> <p>In the year of 1905, the person being reviewed was given an overall rating of 3 out of 5, i.e., an average score. His manager commented that the person devoted his time to “publishing a series of outside papers” and “he has done reasonably well”.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, in 1905, the person published 4 papers. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/andp.19053220607">One</a> of them, “Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt” (or “On a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light” in English), eventually led to the Nobel Prize in Physics in <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/summary/">1921</a>. And this wasn’t even his best result that year – the other being his <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/andp.19053221004">special theory of relativity</a>.</p> <p>From his manager’s perspective, this was an average year for Albert Einstein. For Physics and Human Being, however, this was the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis_papers">annus mirabilis</a>” (miraculous year).</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[performance review is hard ...]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How disruptive ideas were treated?</title><link href="https://fanyangcs.github.io/blog/2023/DisruptiveIdeas/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How disruptive ideas were treated?"/><published>2023-07-02T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-02T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://fanyangcs.github.io/blog/2023/DisruptiveIdeas</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fanyangcs.github.io/blog/2023/DisruptiveIdeas/"><![CDATA[<p>As researchers, we are all encouraged to work on important problems, presumably disruptive ones.</p> <p>However, history tells us that disruptive ideas are often not welcome, at least in the beginning.</p> <p>And here is a perfect example: <a href="/assets/pdf/reject.pdf">reject letters</a> for papers that eventually led to ACM A.M.
