I believe a neural symbolic approach is the only way to realize truthworthy reasoning, thus achieving true intelligence. It is probably the only hope to bridge the seemingly insurmountable gap between "correlation" and "causality".

Here are some useful cases of the neural symbolic approach. And I think the role of a neural-symbolic engine will become much more important in the near future. 
- Synthesizing high-quality, verifiably correct reasoning steps on solving math problems. {% cite NEURIPS2024_NSMR %}.
- Improving the autoformalization, a fundamental math capability of a neural model, through a hybrid neural-symbolic solution. {% cite NEURIPS2024_AutoFormalization %}.
