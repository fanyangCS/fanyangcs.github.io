Agent is an old name, but the importance of agent in this AI era has been well [recoganized](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents). 
The implication of agent to future systems is important, but not yet clear. 
For example, will the future LLM serving systems look more like Parrot {%cite parrot24 %}, or do we need to build new RL simulators like Android Arena {%cite 10.1145/3637528.3671650 %} to enable OS agent?
