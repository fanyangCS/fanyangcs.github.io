Agent is not a new concept, and the importance of agent in the AI era has been well [recoganized](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents). 
An agent can be viewed as a neural-symbolic approach, as discussed [here](https://fanyangcs.github.io/projects/neuralsymbolic/). But I prefer to view agent as intelligence augmented by tools and their associated environments. 
Just as human's capability is greatly enhanced by tools, AI's capability grows significantly with the help of tools.
Our study suggests that AI's math reasoning can be significantly improved with the help of an MCTS-based, code augmented tool {% cite rstarmaths25 %}{% cite rstar2agent25 %}, or a multi-agent system through a generation-discrimination process {% cite qi2025mutualreasoningmakessmaller %}.

It is also worth noting that Agent will influence the future of systems. For example, will the future LLM serving systems look more like Parrot {%cite parrot24 %}, or do we need to build new RL simulators like Android Arena {%cite 10.1145/3637528.3671650 %} to enable OS agent?
