I find this [annual performance review](https://www.norvig.com/performance-review.html) amusing. It happened in '05. Not 2005, but 1905. 

In the year of 1905, the person being reviewed was given an overall rating of 3 out of 5, i.e., an average score. His manager commented that the person devoted his time to "publishing a series of outside papers" and "he has done reasonably well". 

As a matter of fact, in 1905, the person published 4 papers. [One](https://doi.org/10.1002/andp.19053220607) of them, "Ãœber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt" (or "On a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light" in English), eventually led to the Nobel Prize in Physics in [1921](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/summary/). And this wasn't even his best result that year -- the other being his [special theory of relativity](https://doi.org/10.1002/andp.19053221004).

From his manager's perspective, this was an average year for Albert Einstein. For Physics and Human Being, however, this was the "[annus mirabilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis_papers)" (miraculous  year).
