My name is Fan Yang (杨凡 in Chinese). I am a systems researcher and research manager of the [Systems Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-asia/) (SRG) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSR-Asia). My research passion is on Computer Systems. My recent focus is to explore the fundamental principles of the systems for artificial intelligence. The exploration on AI scheduler, AI compiler, and vector store leads to several interesting findings. Some of the techniques discovered (or rediscovered) from the findings have been adopted by Microsoft products like Azure, M365, and Bing, and the corresponding research results have appeared in top system conferences like OSDI/SOSP. As a researcher, I engage in public academic services, including serving on the program committee of ASPLOS ([2022](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2022/index.html%3Fp=44.html)), EuroSys ([2023](https://2023.eurosys.org/pc.html), [2025](https://2025.eurosys.org/pc.html)), ChinaSys (19th). Prior to MSR-Asia, I received my doctoral degree and bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at Nanjing University.
