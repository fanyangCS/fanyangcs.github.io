	abstract     = {To speed up computation, deep neural networks (DNNs) usually rely on highly optimized tensor operators. Despite the effectiveness, tensor operators are often defined empirically with ad hoc semantics. This hinders the analysis and optimization across operator boundaries. FractalTensor is a programming framework that addresses this challenge. At the core, FractalTensor is a nested list-based abstract data type (ADT), where each element is a tensor with static shape or another FractalTensor (i.e., nested). DNNs are then defined by high-order compute operators like map/reduce/scan and data access operators like window/stride on FractalTensor. This new way of DNN definition explicitly exposes nested data parallelism and fine-grained data access patterns, opening new opportunities for whole program analysis and optimization. To exploit these opportunities, from the FractalTensor-based code the compiler extracts a nested multi-dimensional dataflow graph called Extended Task Dependence Graph (ETDG), which provides a holistic view of data dependency across different granularity. The ETDG is then transformed into an efficient implementation through graph coarsening, data reordering, and access materialization. Evaluation on six representative DNNs like RNN and FlashAttention on NVIDIA A100 shows that FractalTensor achieves speedup by up to 5.44x and 1.97x on average through a unified solution for diverse optimizations.},

	abstract     = {Multi-index vector search has become the cornerstone for many applications, such as recommendation systems. Efficient search in such a multi-modal hybrid vector space is challenging since no single index design performs well for all kinds of vector data. Existing approaches to processing multi-index hybrid queries either suffer from algorithmic limitations or processing inefficiency. In this paper, we propose OneSparse, a unified multi-vector index query system that incorporates multiple posting-based vector indices, which enables highly efficient retrieval of multi-modal data-sets. OneSparse introduces a novel multi-index query engine design of inter-index intersection push-down. It also optimizes the vector posting format to expedite multi-index queries. Our experiments show OneSparse achieves more than 6x search performance improvement while maintaining comparable accuracy. OneSparse has already been integrated into Microsoft online web search and advertising systems with 5x+ latency gain for Bing web search and 2.0\% Revenue Per Mille (RPM) gain for Bing sponsored search.},

	abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent agents to execute intricate tasks within domain-specific software such as browsers and games. However, when applied to general-purpose software systems like operating systems, LLM agents face three primary challenges. Firstly, the action space is vast and dynamic, posing difficulties for LLM agents to maintain an up-to-date understanding and deliver accurate responses. Secondly, real-world tasks often require inter-application cooperation, demanding farsighted planning from LLM agents. Thirdly, agents need to identify optimal solutions aligning with user constraints, such as security concerns and preferences. These challenges motivate AndroidArena, an environment and benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on a modern operating system. To address high-cost of manpower, we design a scalable and semi-automated method to construct the benchmark. In the task evaluation, AndroidArena incorporates accurate and adaptive metrics to address the issue of non-unique solutions. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art LLM agents struggle in cross-APP scenarios and adhering to specific constraints. Additionally, we identify a lack of four key capabilities, i.e. understanding, reasoning, exploration, and reflection, as primary reasons for the failure of LLM agents. Furthermore, we provide empirical analysis on the failure of reflection, and improve the success rate by 27\% with our proposed exploration strategy. This work is the first to present valuable insights in understanding fine-grained weakness of LLM agents, and offers a path forward for future research in this area. Environment, benchmark, prompt, and evaluation code for AndroidArena are released at https://github.com/AndroidArenaAgent/AndroidArena.},

	abstract     = {In this paper, we propose NUWA-XL, a novel Diffusion over Diffusion architecture for eXtremely Long video generation. Most current work generates long videos segment by segment sequentially, which normally leads to the gap between training on short videos and inferring long videos, and the sequential generation is inefficient. Instead, our approach adopts a ``coarse-to-fine'' process, in which the video can be generated in parallel at the same granularity. A global diffusion model is applied to generate the keyframes across the entire time range, and then local diffusion models recursively fill in the content between nearby frames. This simple yet effective strategy allows us to directly train on long videos (3376 frames) to reduce the training-inference gap, and makes it possible to generate all segments in parallel. To evaluate our model, we build FlintstonesHD dataset, a new benchmark for long video generation. Experiments show that our model not only generates high-quality long videos with both global and local coherence, but also decreases the average inference time from 7.55min to 26s (by 94.26\%) at the same hardware setting when generating 1024 frames.

	abstract     = {3D photography renders a static image into a video with appealing 3D visual effects. Existing approaches typically first conduct monocular depth estimation, then render the input frame to subsequent frames with various viewpoints, and finally use an inpainting model to fill those missing/ occluded regions. The inpainting model plays a crucial role in rendering quality, but it is normally trained on out-of-domain data. To reduce the training and inference gap, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion model as the inpainting module. Given a single input image, we automatically construct a training pair of the masked occluded image and the ground-truth image with random cycle rendering. The constructed training samples are closely aligned to the testing instances, without the need for data annotation. To make full use of the masked images, we designed a Masked Enhanced Block (MEB), which can be easily plugged into the UNet and enhance the semantic conditions. Towards real-world animation, we present a novel task: out-animation, which extends the space and time of input objects. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that our method achieves competitive results with existing SOTA methods.},

	abstract     = {Vector quantization (VQ) based ANN indexes, such as Inverted File System (IVF) and Product Quantization (PQ), have been widely applied to embedding based document retrieval thanks to the competitive time and memory efficiency. Originally, VQ is learned to minimize the reconstruction loss, i.e., the distortions between the original dense embeddings and the reconstructed embeddings after quantization. Unfortunately, such an objective is inconsistent with the goal of selecting ground-truth documents for the input query, which may cause severe loss of retrieval quality. Recent works identify such a defect, and propose to minimize the retrieval loss through contrastive learning. However, these methods intensively rely on queries with ground-truth documents, whose performance is limited by the insufficiency of labeled data. In this paper, we propose Distill-VQ, which unifies the learning of IVF and PQ within a knowledge distillation framework. In Distill-VQ, the dense embeddings are leveraged as "teachers'', which predict the query's relevance to the sampled documents. The VQ modules are treated as the "students'', which are learned to reproduce the predicted relevance, such that the reconstructed embeddings may fully preserve the retrieval result of the dense embeddings. By doing so, Distill-VQ is able to derive substantial training signals from the massive unlabeled data, which significantly contributes to the retrieval quality. We perform comprehensive explorations for the optimal conduct of knowledge distillation, which may provide useful insights for the learning of VQ based ANN index. We also experimentally show that the labeled data is no longer a necessity for high-quality vector quantization, which indicates Distill-VQ's strong applicability in practice. The evaluations are performed on MS MARCO and Natural Questions benchmarks, where Distill-VQ notably outperforms the SOTA VQ methods in Recall and MRR.

To cover language, image, and video at the same time for different scenarios, a 3D transformer encoder-decoder framework is designed, which can not only deal with videos as 3D data but also adapt to texts and images as 1D and 2D data, respectively. A 3D Nearby Attention (3DNA) mechanism is also proposed to consider the nature of the visual data and reduce the computational complexity. We evaluate N{\"U}WA on 8 downstream tasks. Compared to several strong baselines, N{\"U}WA achieves state-of-the-art results on text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, video prediction, etc. Furthermore, it also shows surprisingly good zero-shot capabilities on text-guided image and video manipulation tasks.}

We extend a recent cross-lingual pre-trained model Unicoder (Huang et al., 2019) to cover both understanding and generation tasks, which is evaluated on XGLUE as a strong baseline.

It is designed to scale up to multicores on a single server, as well as scale out to multiple servers in a cluster, offering significant, often over an order-of-magnitude, improvement over existing distributed graph engines on evaluated graph algorithms. GraM is also capable of processing graphs that are significantly larger than previously reported. In particular, using 64 servers (1,024 physical cores), it performs a PageRank iteration in 140 seconds on a synthetic graph with over one trillion edges, setting a new milestone for graph engines.GraM's efficiency and scalability comes from a judicious architectural design that exploits the benefits of multi-core and RDMA. GraM uses a simple message-passing based scaling architecture for both scaling up and scaling out to expose inherent parallelism. It further benefits from a specially designed multi-core aware RDMA-based communication stack that preserves parallelism in a balanced way and allows overlapping of communication and computation. A high degree of parallelism often comes at the cost of lower efficiency due to resource fragmentation. GraM is equipped with an adaptive mechanism that evaluates the cost and benefit of parallelism to decide the appropriate configuration. Combined, these mechanisms allow GraM to scale up and out with high efficiency.},

Many tools can help us win these battles: model checkers to verify, fault injection to find bugs, replay to debug, and many more. Unfortunately, tools are currently afterthoughts in cloud service designs that must either be tediously tangled into service implementations or integrated transparently in ways that fail to effectively capture the service’s problematic non-deterministic (concurrent, asynchronous, and resource access) behavior. This paper makes tooling a first-class concern by having services encoded with tasks whose interactions reliably capture all non-deterministic behavior needed by tools. Task interactions are then exposed in aspects that are useful in encoding cross-cutting behavior; combined, tools encoded as task aspects can integrate with services effectively and transparently. We show how task aspects can be used to ease the development of an online production data service that runs on a hundred machines.},

As a computing platform, Kineograph further supports graph-mining algorithms to extract timely insights from the fast-changing graph structure. To accommodate graph-mining algorithms that assume a static underlying graph, Kineograph creates a series of consistent snapshots, using a novel and efficient epoch commit protocol. To keep up with continuous updates on the graph, Kineograph includes an incremental graph-computation engine. We have developed three applications on top of Kineograph to analyze Twitter data: user ranking, approximate shortest paths, and controversial topic detection. For these applications, Kineograph takes a live Twitter data feed and maintains a graph of edges between all users and hashtags. Our evaluation shows that with 40 machines processing 100K tweets per second, Kineograph is able to continuously compute global properties, such as user ranks, with less than 2.5-minute timeliness guarantees. This rate of traffic is more than 10 times the reported peak rate of Twitter as of October 2011.},

These range from support for disconnected operation to relational and event-driven models. Sonora's execution engine is a fault-tolerant distributed runtime that supports user-facing continuous sensing and processing services in the cloud. Key features of this engine are its dynamic load balancing mechanisms, and a novel failure recovery protocol that performs checkpoint-based partial rollback recovery with selective re-execution. To illustrate the relevance and power of the stream abstraction in describing complex mobile-cloud services we evaluate Sonora's design in the context of two services. We also validate Sonora's design, demonstrating that Sonora is efficient, scalable, and provides responsive fault tolerance.},

Specifically, we formulate it as an optimization problem, i.e., minimizing the total transmission power over transmission data rates, subject to the traffic requirements of all the nodes in a multi-hop network. Interestingly, we can show that this problem is actually a well-known multiple-choice knapsack problem, which is proven to be an NP-hard problem. So, instead of finding an optimal solution, which is NP-hard, we seek a sub-optimal solution. Our key technique to attack this problem is distributed cooperative rate adaptation. Here, we promote node cooperation due to our observation that the inequality in non-cooperative channel contention among nodes caused by hidden terminal phenomenon in a multi-hop network tends to result in energy inefficiency. Under this design philosophy, we propose a distributed cooperative rate adaptation (CRA) scheme and prove that it converges. Simulation results show that our CRA scheme can reduce the power consumption up to 86\% as compared to the existing (non-cooperative) algorithm.},
