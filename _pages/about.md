I am currently a systems researcher and research manager of the [Systems Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-asia/) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSR-Asia). I joined MSR-Asia after receiving my doctoral degree and bachelor's degree in [computer science](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at Nanjing University.

My research passion is on computer system. Recently I have been exploring the fundamental principles behind the systems that support emerging applications, e.g., machine learning based intelligent tasks. I am an architect of the machine learning systems [OpenPAI](https://github.com/microsoft/pai), [NNFusion](https://github.com/microsoft/nnfusion), and [NNI](https://github.com/microsoft/nni), which have been used by Microsoft products like Bing and Azure. As open-source projects, these systems also have a growing number of external users across the world.
 
In the past, I worked on graph systems. The graph systems I co-developed like [GraM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2806777.2806849) set a new speed record for trillion-scale graph analytics and have been used by Bing to improve Ads coverage and web mining. I also contributed to [SCOPE](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00778-012-0280-z), Microsoft's big data engine. I helped re-architect and optimize the SCOPE-based analytic pipeline of Bing Ads team, improving its processing capacity by more than 50%, which generated tens of millions of dollar of additional revenue.
