My name is Fan Yang (Êù®Âá° in Chinese). I am a systems researcher and research manager of the [Systems Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-asia/) (SRG) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSR-Asia). I joined MSR-Asia after receiving my doctoral degree and bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at Nanjing University. 

My research passion lies in Computer Systems. My recent focus is on exploring the fundamental principles of the [systems for Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://fanyangcs.github.io/projects/). I am among the first to discover and advocate the now well-known design principles for AI systems, including the hardware-aligned *tile abstraction* for [AI compilers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/building-a-heavy-metal-quartet-of-ai-compilers/) and the *relaxed monotonicity* for [vector stores](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/unified-database-laying-the-foundation-for-large-language-model-vertical-applications/). Some techniques and solutions derived from these principles have been open-sourced and adopted by Microsoft products like Azure, M365, and Bing, and the corresponding research results have appeared in top systems conferences like OSDI/SOSP. Some open-source projects like [OpenPAI](https://github.com/microsoft/pai) or [NNI](https://github.com/microsoft/nni) even incubated new businesses. More recently, I have been passionate about the co-design of AI algorithms and systems, which I believe will define the next chapter of AI. In the past, I worked on large-scale systems, such as graph systems. I co-developed [GraM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2806777.2806849), a high-performance graph engine that set a new speed record for trillion-scale graph analytics.

As a researcher, I also engage in public academic services, including serving on the program committees of ASPLOS ([2022](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2022/index.html%3Fp=44.html)), ChinaSys (19th), EuroSys ([2023](https://2023.eurosys.org/pc.html), [2025](https://2025.eurosys.org/pc.html), [2026](https://2026.eurosys.org/pc.html)), OSDI ([2026](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi26/call-for-papers)).
