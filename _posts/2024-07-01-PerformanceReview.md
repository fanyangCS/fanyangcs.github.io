I find this [annual performance review](https://www.norvig.com/performance-review.html) amusing. It happened at '05. Not 2005, but 1905. 

In the year of 1905, the person being reviewed was given an overall rating of 3 out of 5, i.e., an average score. His manager commented that the person devoted his time to "publishing a series of outside papers" and "he has done reasonably well". 

As a matter of fact, in the year of 1905, the person published 5 papers. One paper, "On a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light", eventually led to Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. And this is not even his best result in that year! (The other being Relativity).

From his manager's point of view, this was an average year for Albert Einstein. For Physics and Human Being, this was a revolutionary year.
