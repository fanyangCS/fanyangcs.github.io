Agent is an old name, but the importance of agent in this AI era has been well [recoganized](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents). 
An agent can be viewed as a neural-symbolic approach, as discussed [here](https://fanyangcs.github.io/projects/neuralsymbolic/). But I prefer to view an agent as intelligence augmented by tools. 
Just as human's capability is greatly enhanced by tools, I believe AI's capability will grow significantly with the help of tools.
Our study suggests that AI's math reasoning can be significantly improved with the help of an MCTS-based, code augmented tool{% rstarmaths25 %}.

It is also worth noting that Agent will influence the future of systems. For example, will the future LLM serving systems look more like Parrot {%cite parrot24 %}, or do we need to build new RL simulators like Android Arena {%cite 10.1145/3637528.3671650 %} to enable OS agent?
