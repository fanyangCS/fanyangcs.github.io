I believe the neural symbolic approach is the only way to realize truthworthy reasoning, thus achieving true intelligence. 

Here are some useful cases of the neural symbolic approach. And I think the role of a neural-symbolic engine will become much more important in the near future. 
- Synthesizing high-quality, verifiably correct reasoning steps on solving math problems. {% cite NEURIPS2024_NSMR %}.
- Improving the autoformalization, a fundamental math capability of a neural model, through a hybrid neural-symbolic solution. {% cite NEURIPS2024_AutoFormalization %}.
