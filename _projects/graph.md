In the past, I was interested in Graph due to its complex structure and the potential in application domains like social network, web, and bio-science. I developed several graph engines. Specifically, Kineograph {% cite 10.1145/2168836.2168846 %} is designed for OLAP and OLTP on fast changing graphs, Chronos {% cite 10.1145/2592798.2592799 %} is a system for temporal graph analytics, and GraM {% cite 10.1145/2806777.2806849 %} is a high-performance graph engine that set a new speed record for trillion-scale graph analytics. GraM has been used to analyze the large-scale web data and internal Ads data of the Microsoft Bing service.
